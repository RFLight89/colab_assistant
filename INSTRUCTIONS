- to use assistant you need actual api key for LLM model, such as OpenAI
- Copy code from colab_assistant_main_page to Colab page
- run installations first
- run main code
- enter api and endpoint (if tunneling) to LLM on 'Настройки' page (Settings)
- get notebooks on 'Обработка данных' page (Process data)
- after that create database on same page
